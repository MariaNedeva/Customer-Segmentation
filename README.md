In this notebook I applied RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) Analysis using SQL to identify customers who are 'lost', 'at risk', 'slipping away' and 'active'. In the recent future I will upload results from the dashboard analysis.
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/customer-segmentation-dataset/) # Customer-Segmentation
